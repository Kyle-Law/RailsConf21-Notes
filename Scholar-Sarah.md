# Notes regarding guiding scholar Sarah

### Meeting (11 Apr 21, 2pm - 2.45pm)

##### Question asked
- What's the future in Rails?
> Also the question I'm trying to answer especially among other rising full stack frameworks. But it's common for a developer to have different tech stack in hand and not putting all eggs in one basket.
- How do I transition into Rails?
> mainly via Microverse Software Development Program.
- What's the moment when I felt I got the hang in Rails?
> Few breakthroughs of my rails journey: Feeling comfortable in building full stack CRUD app in Rails > comfortable with integrating vanilla JS into Rails.
- How is Ruby on Rails community in Malaysia? It's not that active in Indonesia
> Kind of similar? Not much opportunities about Ruby on Rails in Malaysia as far as I'm concern. In fact there's only 1 ROR position in my city, Johor Bahru
- Can Hotwire replace / make JavaScript obsolete? Since she's not that familiar in JS.
> Probably not..? I'll have a better answer after attending the conference.
